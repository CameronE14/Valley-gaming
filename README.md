<h1 align=center> Valley Gaming </h1>

This is my where you'll find my Gaming news/highlight website. The hope for this website is for it to become a hub for small indi game news, mostly grass roots developers. I will hopefully get dedicated writers with talent for capturing and conveying the scope of these big projects from little companies. In the mean time, there will be plenty of easy to digest lists on there.

This site is mainly targeted at core gaming audiences and people with a passion for indi game development.

### Testing

For my testing I used HTML Validator and CSS Validator.

The HTML validator helped with debuging href links inside of images.
I now know that I need to wrap a <img> inside of an <a> tag to allow it to be a clickable link.
It also notified my of my use of H7. I then realised H7 onwards are not symantic and have no purpose.
  
The only warning I have currently are for my use of aria-labels for my twitter,insta and twitch icons. The HTML validator is suggesting these may not need to be used, but the icon text I have used are symbols, so I believe the aria-label is needed for these.

Thankfully, my CSS was free from any errors.
