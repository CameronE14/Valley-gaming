            <h1>The Top 10 Games of All Time (In my opinion)</h1>
            <p>A run down of the greatest games of all time. Though, this is completely opinion based and you'll
                have a
                different list than mine. I'd like to celebrate my love for these games by giving them some
                attention.

            <h2>10. Hollow Knight</h2>
            <p>As indi games go, this has everything. A mysterious atmosphere, deep lore, incredible music and
                tight
                gameplay.
                I'd consider this a mixture of 2 genres; Souls-like & Metroidvania, with anyone thats played a
                Souls
                game understanding the death mechanic and probably being comfortable with difficulty curve, and
                fans
                of Metroidvania will love the open exploritory nauture of the game.
                With interesting characters, art-style that pops every chance it can get, and the different
                biomes
                that feel very unique. You'll find yourself lost in one of the greatest indi games available
                right
                now.

            <h2>9. Zelda: Ocarina of Time</h2>
            <p>THis game blew me away as a kid. I couldn't get over the sheer scale of it. It was actually my
                first
                introduction to Zelda, and what an introduction it was. This'll probably make a lot of peoples
                lists, but for me its the music. Ocarina of Time has one of the most addictive soundtracks
                (Gerudo
                Valley) and some really catchy tunes that I still hum to this day.</p>

            <h2>8. Chrono Trigger</h2>
            <p>The fact there hasn't been a game like Chrono Trigger since it came out is testiment to the
                masterclass that it is.
                Its a shame there hasnt been a re-release of this game on a modern console, because it needs to
                be
                experienced by modern audiences.
                A JRPG that has you journeying through time from the prehistoric to the ruined future, wrapped
                in
                art from Akira Toriyama (DBZ) and a great soundtrack, In my opinion this is the best 16-bit game
                of
                its time.

            <h2>7. Half-Life 2</h2>
            <p>When I say Half-Life 2, what I actually mean is everything that came with it. Yes, its a great
                game
                on its own. But we need to remember when buying HL2 you got Counter Strike: Source and Half-Life
                2:
                Deathmatch. Two absolutley increadible games alongside what people consider one of the best FPS
                games ever released at that point.</p>

            <h2>6. World of Warcraft</h2>
            <p>WoW has taken a knock as of late, but that doesn't diminish what it's achieved.
                Before WoW, MMORPGs weren't exactly widely known or played. The biggest was probably EverQuest.
                The technological leap between these two games was massive. Nobody had ever seen a game like WoW
                before and it blew the competition out of the water. With an already established brand and story
                people were already invested before even making thier first character. With an emphasis on group
                activity, people actually had to talk to other players to get stuff done.
                It had a massive world and lots of content that people would sink thousands of hours into.

            <h2>5. Dark Souls</h2>
            <p>I could easily list Bloodborne or any of the other souls games here. But for me, this is the game
                that hooked me. There's nothing like beating that one boss you've been stuck on for days or even
                weeks. There's a real sense of skill progression and you can feel yourself getting better at the
                game with every "VICTORY ACHIEVED"
                Let's not forget this game is set in a fantastical medieval world with knights, dragons and
                magic
                which adds to the brutality of the game.</p>

            <h2>4. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h2>
            <p>There's no game quite like The Witcher 3. The setting and story keep players engrossed with tight
                and
                sometimes difficuly combat to really give the game some flair. Graphically it was easily the
                best
                thing around at release and with the difinitive edition coming to the current gen, I look
                forward to
                seeing
                this game back in the limelight.</p>

            <h2>3. Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn</h2>
            <p>Words cannot describe how incredible this game is. The story, the music, the community. The
                developers have turned this into something special. Every expansion builds on the game and
                really
                gives the players a special experience.
                It has well balanced gameplay and tightly designed multiplayer content. The world is massive
                too,
                with it being mostly instanced it gives each zone a real unique feeling with something to see in
                each corner of Eorzea.</p>

            <h2>2. Disco Elysium</h2>
            <p>There's currently nothing like Disco Elysium. I tried this on the off chance that I may like it
                and
                it blew me away. Revachol is the setting for a brutal murder and its up to our alchohol induced
                amnesiac detective to crack the case. There's lots of ways to play Disco Elysium and all of them
                are
                correct, with each playthrough being unique if you want it to be. This is THE game I recommend
                to
                anyone looking for something different.

            <h2>1. Final Fantasy VII</h2>
            <p>No surprise here I guess, someone who's a massive fan of JRPGs is putting FF7 at the top of this
                list. But come on, this game is great. I can't expres how much this game means to me and other
                fans.
                This was my introduction to JRPGs and Final Fantasy as a whole. I haven't got anything
                insightful to
                say about FF7 that hasn't been said by someone else, other than I believe this game is very
                important to not just players, but the entire industry and really changed the way stories were
                told.
